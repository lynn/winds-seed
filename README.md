# Wind's Seed

Wind's Seed is a short JRPG for the PC-9801, released in 1995 by Compile.

This repository contains a Python script `main.py`, that currently extracts the story data, and applies some patches for reinsertion that I've taken from [46OkuMen's exploration of this game](https://github.com/46OkuMen/windseed). Thank you!

## Usage

```sh
copy C:\wherever\Winds_Seed.FDI .
python3 main.py
```
